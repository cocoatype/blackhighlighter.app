Black Highlighter makes it easy to hide text in images you want to share. Black Highlighter's "Magic Highlighting" feature automatically detects text in images and helps you make nice, even redactions in your photos and screenshots.

## App Integrations

Black Highlighter works with your favorite apps to hide text from anywhere.

### Photo Editing

### Workflow

Black Highlighter supports the [X-Callback-URL](http://x-callback-url.com) scheme to be called from within Workflow.

[Highlight Last Screenshot](#) is an example workflow that finds the last screenshot that was taken on your iPhone or iPad and opens it in Black Highlighter.
