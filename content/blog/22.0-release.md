Black Highlighter for macOS 22.0 is out now, with a new way to start redacting: "New from Clipboard".

<!--more-->

Black Highlighter can now open images directly from the macOS clipboard instead of needing to save something to a file first. This can streamline some common workflows. For example, taking a screenshot of a chat thread. Rather than taking the screenshot, waiting for it to save, and then needing to find it in Black Highlighter's file picker, you can hold the Control key to copy the screenshot to your clipboard instead. Then, using New from Clipboard, the screenshot is immediately available. When you save your redactions, you can choose exactly where you want to put the finished file.

Hopefully this helps make your experience using Black Highlighter even faster! Happy highlighting!
