Black Highlighter 22.7 improves the Magic Highlighter's accuracy, especially when redacting small words such as "it" or "as". Previously, the Magic Highlighter would redact the word and quite a bit of space on either side of it, meaning the beginning or end of surrounding words could accidentally also get redacted. The new version of the Magic Highlighter is much better at sticking to just the word you meant to redactâ€”and nothing extra.

Additionally, this version fixes a few bugs:
- Fixed a crash that could happen when saving a new image to your Photo Library.
- Fixed an issue with automatic redactions where the button to add new words didn't appear, making it impossible to add more than one word to the list.
