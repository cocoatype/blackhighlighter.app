Bug fixes! One for you and one for me:

There was a bug where the preview that you saw prior to saving an image didn't look exactly like what got exported. Previews would show a solid black box, while the export would have the fancy "marker" effects applied. Now the preview has the same effects, so you can see what you're actually doing.

Black Highlighter was supposed to prompt for App Store ratings occasionally after you saved or shared an image. A bug prevented this from happening. If you like Black Highlighter, please take advantage of the fact that this bug is now fixed. :)
