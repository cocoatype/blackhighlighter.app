More bug fixes to make your redacting experience even better.

- Fixed "Open Inâ€¦" not actually opening images.
- Albums list is now called "Albums", instead of "Photos" or "Back".
- Tweaked settings page design.
- Cleaned up some system integration issues that **probably** weren't actually causing bugs?
