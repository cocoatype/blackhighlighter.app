This update introduces a new tool to the Black Highlighter toolset: the Magic Eraâ€¦ er, the eraser. The totally normal eraser. Made a mistake and redacted too much? Switch to the eraser and bring back the text you didn't want to lose.

Additionally, try out these other fun fixes:
- The Magic Highlighter and Manual Highlighter icons are now easier to tell apart.
- Fixed a minor performance issue when selecting areas to redact.
- Fixed an issue on iOS with saving to the photos library sometimes being *incredibly* slow or crashing.
- Improved design in light mode on macOS.
