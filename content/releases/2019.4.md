We’ve made a new tool available to you: the Ultra Highlighter. The Ultra Highlighter puts some powerful new technology: 

- Specify certain words to always be hidden: names, e-mail addresses, etc. The Ultra Highlighter will automatically black them out when you open a new image.
- Scan documents from the real world for digital redaction. The Ultra Highlighter senses documents in photos, straightens them out, and gives them the same scanning technology fully-digital screenshots get.

The Ultra Highlighter is available as a one-time upgrade purchase, and is already unlocked for anyone who downloaded Black Highlighter prior to this update.

We’ve also added some improvements for all users of Black Highlighter:

- Black Highlighter now supports multiple windows on iPadOS 13.1 or newer.
- Alerts such as the one that appears if you close an image without exporting it are now properly dark if you’re using the system dark mode.
- Users of VoiceOver on iOS 13 or higher can now use the text-hiding functionality of Black Highlighter via VoiceOver, rather than only being able to navigate the app, but requiring touch to actually hide text.
- Numerous minor bug fixes and visual improvements.
