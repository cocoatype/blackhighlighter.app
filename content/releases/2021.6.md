It's the iPad update! A lot of work has gone into making this version the best iPad app it can be:

- Cleaned up the iPad editing design to better take advantage of the extra space on the iPad.
- Fixed a bug causing selections in the albums sidebar to be blue instead of the appropriate dark gray. Thanks to iOS developer Peter Witham for the assist on this fix.
- The albums sidebar now shows your current selection at all times instead of disappearing after you change it.
- Made the scroll bar look right in the settings view in light mode.
