Black Highlighter 23.1 comes with a new set of bug fixes:

- When switching between photo albums, you are now shown your most-recent photos rather than a random spot in the middle.
- If you viewed the settings page in light mode, it was previously bright white instead of the correct gray color. It now looks like it should.
- Fixed an issue where the toolbar on the editing page could have a split appearance (half-black, half-gray).
- The app may now requests App Store ratings for all types of saving; previously if you saved via the "Done" button, it would never do this.

On that last note, if you're reading these release notes, please leave a rating for Black Highlighter! It'd be a great help.
