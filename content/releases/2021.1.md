Just cleaning up a few of the "initial version" hiccups for the Mac version of Black Highlighter:

- Fixed a bug where dragging an image to the app icon to open it didn't work if the preferences window was open.
- Implemented the "Open Recent" menu so you can quickly get back to a file you've edited in the past.
