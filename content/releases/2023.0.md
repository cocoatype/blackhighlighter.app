Black Highlighter 23.0 introduces support for redacting text at any angle. Even if you didn't get the perfect scan or photo, Black Highlighter can now find text in your image and hide it. 

This release also fixes an issue sharing redacted images on iPad, and adds additional error logging to help me keep on top of common errors like this.
