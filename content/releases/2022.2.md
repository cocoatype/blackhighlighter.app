Black Highlighter 22.2 brings you a whole lot of bug fixes and polish. Hold on to your butts:

If you used the new Find mode from Black Highlighter 22.0, sometimes autocorrect would add an extra space to what you were searching for and then Find mode couldn't find what you were searching for. Find mode is now smarter, and will ignore extra space around your search.

Using Find mode or the Ultra Highlighter automatic find would not trigger the alert that protects you from losing your work if you hit Done before you were, well, done. Now it should show up no matter how you've made your redactions.

If you were using a limited selection of your photos with Black Highlighter, and then you added more photos, Black Highlighter would ask you if you wanted to add EVEN MORE photos, which is a weird time to ask that. Black Highlighter now never asks you for additional photo permission, which is the more appropriate time.

Also, while you were adding more photos to your selection, there was a single solitary weird blue arrow. That arrow has been appropriately chastised and is now wearing the proper uniform.

On macOS, the animation for the Find mode's search field was WAY too dramatic. Like NYOOOM! CHECK ME OUT, I'M FIND MODE! WHO'S READY TO SEARCH FOR STUFF?! Now it's more like "hey. i'm find mode. feel free to do whatever at your own pace. i'll be over here."
