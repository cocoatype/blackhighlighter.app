Black Highlighter 22.1 includes a new feature: Find mode. With Find mode, you can type in a word you'd like to redact (such as a person's name) and with a single tap, Black Highlighter automatically finds and hides every occurrence of that word. Find mode helps you cover up every place that word appears, and do so quickly and easily.

This release improves the experience of using the "Reduce Motion" accessibility setting. It also fixes a crash when saving after hitting the Done button.
