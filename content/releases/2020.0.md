This release improves the performance and stability of Black Highlighter when editing large photos, such as those taken by newer iPhones. If you were previously encountering long hangs or app crashes when editing photos in the app, please try again with this update.

This release also fixes a few small UI glitches, such as the wrong font appearing on the settings page.
