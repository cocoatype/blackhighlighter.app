Black Highlighter 22.3 comes with a small dose of AutoMAYtion goodies. Black Highlighter now has a new, smarter Shortcut action: "Redact Detected Items". Redact Detected Items locates addresses, phone numbers, or people's names and automatically redacts them. Use it in the Shortcuts app to quickly redact personal information from large batches of images! This release also fixes a few bugs with Shortcuts support on macOS; if you're working on a Mac, automated redaction should now be faster and more reliable.

Shortcuts didn't get **all** the love, though. This release also adds a "Share Image" option to the alert that appears if you try to close a redacted image before saving it, allowing you to quickly send it somewhere other than your photo library.
