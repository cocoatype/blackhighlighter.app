This is a fairly major update to Black Highlighter with several new features to check out:

- Find the images you want to redact more easily by navigating your library via albums and smart collections.
- Identify different speakers in an image by using different colors of redactions.
- Create automated workflows using the power of Black Highlighter in the Shortcuts app.
- Keep your images private, even from Black Highlighter, with support for the new limited photo library in iOS 14.
