This update just fixes a lot of little papercuts. We're planning a larger new feature coming soon, but for now, let's just make your redacting experience a little nicer.

Here's the fixes we made:
- Fixed some broken entries in the macOS help menu
- Added automatic restoration on macOS so you can quit the app and then launch right back to where you were.
- Updated the settings design on iOS.
- Fixed a bug where you were unable to select new photos if you had not given Black Highlighter full access to your photo library.
- Related, fixed a bug where using "only selected photos" could display two document scanner buttons.
