This is the "make life a little nicer" update. We've gone and fixed a ton of the little papercuts in Black Highlighter to make using it a better experience.

Here's the fixes we made:
- Major performance improvements when initially scanning a new image. No more waiting to tap buttons or start highlighting!
- Fixed several causes of crashes when using the "hide text" iOS action extension in other apps.
- Fixed a crash that could happen when saving an image on iOS.
- Updated the settings design on iOS.
- Fixed a bug where you were unable to select new photos if you had not given Black Highlighter full access to your photo library.
- Related, fixed a bug where using "only selected photos" could display two document scanner buttons.
- Fixed some broken entries in the macOS help menu.
- Added automatic restoration on macOS so you can quit the app and then launch right back to where you were.
- Cleaned up the design of the open dialog on macOS.
