This version fixes a common bug where the exported image was completely transparent, solid black, or solid white. My sincere apologies for the number of people this affected and the time it took me to get a fix out. Thank you to everyone who reported the issue or helped test a fix.

Along the way, I also fixed a few other bugs:
- Some images would be rotated and squashed compared to the original. These images are now exported correctly.
- Exported file sizes are now much smaller.
- Sharing an image via the "done" alert previously did not include your redactions. Now it does.
- Fixed a crash when opening the document scanner or photo importer after saving an image to the photo library.

And even found time to include an actual feature: a new iOS 16-style toolbar on iPad!
