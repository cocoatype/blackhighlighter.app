This release improves many parts of Black Highlighter for users of accessibility technologies such as VoiceOver and Switch Control. This includes:

- Fixing the name of the color and tool picker buttons when read by VoiceOver or Voice Control.
- Fixing layout issues on the in-app purchase screen when using some Dynamic Type sizes.
- Marking many button actions throughout the app, such as selecting a photo or redacting text.
- Adding a VoiceOver rotor for navigating only redacted words.
- Enabling single-action redaction when using the Switch Control gliding cursor.
- Correctly handling erasing redactions when using VoiceOver, Voice Control, or Switch Control.
