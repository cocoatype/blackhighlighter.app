On iOS and iPadOS, this release fixes a few cosmetic issues:

- When selecting a single image (instead of giving Highlighter access to your photo library), some buttons were hard to read if using light mode. This UI is now permanently dark mode, the only correct option.
- When scanning documents, some buttons were hard to read if using dark mode. This has been fixed, as I never want to give a reason for someone to prefer light mode.
- On some iPads, the settings menu displayed only a "Settings" button, which took you to the real settings menu. The settings button on the main menu should now actually take you directly to the real settings menu. This bug occurred regardless of your choice of dark mode vs. wrong mode.

On macOS, this release adds a new feature: "New from Clipboard", which allows you to hide text from whatever image is on your clipboard instead of opening a file.
