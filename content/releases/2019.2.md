You can now use Black Highlighter's editing tools from inside other apps as an action. Try it out in the Photos app!

Other changes:

- Fixed a crash that could happen if you got too creative with your photo library while Black Highlighter was open.
- Added some keyboard shortcuts to the editing view; you can now undo and redo redactions with the standard shortcuts.
